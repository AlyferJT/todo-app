# A Beautiful Todo App!!
## FIRST OF ALL 😊
<p>This was a project to apply all i learned this week</p>
<p>- I learned how to implement a Draggable content in this project</p>
<p>- Learned how to use useReducer in my advantage, to have more organization on my components</p>
<p>- Learned about the Context API, that was a key for passing functions and values trough the components</p>
<p>So, i'm really happy with the result, but i know, there is a lot to learn, and i'm going for it</p>
